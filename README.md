# Data-Collection-Data-quality
This section contains an analysis of different types of data like text data, positional data, audio data, etc using python.
Task 1
Web scraping is one of the data collection methods and is used to capture dynamic data, images and links from
online resources such as websites, etc. You will learn to ethically scrape necessary data. The
quality of data depends on the source of data which needs to be considered prior scraping.
You will learn to scrape textual and numerical information from websites. I have done three tasks which includes
1. capturing textual data from websites, 
2. market data from an e-commerce site and 
3. weather data from two weather sites
Getting data from multiple websites helps in scaling and fault tolerance.
